  def welcome_message
    %(ðŸ‘‹ Hi, welcome to the idea machine. Here's how it works:

Everytime you have an idea, snap a picture and send it to me.
Make sure to send it as a photo and not a file.
You can add a caption to the photo if you'd like.

Type /meals to see all the meals you've eaten.
Type /link to get a secret link to your private profile

You can turn on /reminders to get notified when you haven't uploaded an idea in a while.
Type /reminders to toggle your reminders on/off.

Happy ideation! ðŸ’¡

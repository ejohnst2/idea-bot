      ðŸ‘‹ Hi there,

I will help you eat more. Here's how it works:

Every time you eat a meal. Snap a picture and send it to me. Make sure to send it as a photo and not a file. You can add a caption to the photo if you'd like.

Type /meals to see all the meals you've eaten.
Type /link to get a secret link to your private profile

You can turn on /reminders to get notified when you haven't eaten in a while. Type /reminders to toggle your reminders on/off.

Bon appetite!

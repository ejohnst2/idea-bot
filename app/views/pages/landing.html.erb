  <h2>Ideas arenâ€™t important to hold on to, their only importance is in sharing them with others.</h2>
  <p>
    Ideas have consequences that can transform society. Everything from the phones in our pocket to the socio-economic systems that govern us to the way we move around cities begin with a single idea. We created [title] to manifest our ideas with a curated community of makers from around the world.
